/**
 * A Pipeline is the main conduit through which an {@link Action} is run. An
 * {@link Action} is executed in response to the Pipeline receiving an event.
 * The majority of the events are self-initiated from within the Pipeline
 * itself. The only case thus-far where external entities create events are in
 * response to asynchronous responses from servers. A {@link Response} instance
 * is created on completion of an asynchronous request and is fed back into the
 * Pipeline where an appropriate 'response handler' action is executed.
 * 
 * <p/>
 * 
 * A Pipeline instance is created per-request inside {@link RoutedStore}. This
 * is due to the fact that it includes internal state, specific to each
 * operation request (get, getAll, getVersions, put, and delete) invocation.
