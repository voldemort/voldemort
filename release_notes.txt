Release 1.4.3 on 07/03/2013

Note: Server changes are not backwards compatible. To use new
rebalancing tooling, servers must be upgraded before hand.

* Rebalance features
  - Proxying / abortable rebalance
    - added proxy puts which rebalance safely abortable
    - improved proxy gets to check locally first and only fetch remote
      if not yet local
  - Repartitioning: improved algorithms to optimize partition layout
  - Plan: avoids cross-zone data movement in most rebalance cases. Only
    expanding into a new zone requires data movement across zones.
  - Controller
    - better / more accurate progress monitoring.
    - 'proxy pause' before rebalancing. Ensures clients pick up new
      metadata and allows performance with proxy'ing to be observed
      before servers start rebalancing.
  - NOTE: Donor-based rebalance is currently broken by these changes.
* Rebalance tooling
  - PartitionBalanceCLI: more nuanced and verbose analysis of cluster
    balance
  - RepartitionerCLI: Stand alone tool to determine repartitioning
  - Stand alone 'repartitioning' scripts for key use cases: new cluster,
    shuffle (existing cluster), cluster expansion, and zone expansion.
  - RebalancePlanCLI: Stand alone plan tool to determine cost of a
    specific rebalance
  - RebalanceControllerCLI: Stand-alone tool for executing a specific
    rebalance (plan)
* Administrivia
  - java 7 compilation
  - moved to Guava from Google Collections
  - better unit test coverage of zoned clusters
  - added example prod configuration
  - added tools directory
  - .gitignore improvements
* Bug fixes
  - fixed concurrency bugs in metadata store
  - fixed vector clock comparisons
  - fixed many NPEs
  - write slops in more cases when they are needed
  - KeySampler/Fetcher handle larger working sets with OOME

Changes made since 1.4.2
* Minor code fixes
* Faster creation of BaseStoreRoutingPlan objects in the fast rebalancing path

Release 1.4.2 on 06/27/2013
* Fixing costly StoreRoutingPlan object construction

Release 1.4.0 on 06/21/2013
* Zone expansion release

Release 1.3.4 on 06/19/2013
* Read Write store bug fixes
  - Rewrite of InMemoryStorageEngine + config to control multiVersionPuts
  - Fixed a bug in the read-repair logic which was causing unnecessary puts.
  - Fixed put operation in PipelineRoutedStore to ensure slop is submitted
  - Fixed VectorClock bug triggered during versioned puts
* Rebalance improvement
  - Made it safe to abort rebalance
  - Proxy puts are established so that 'old' partition is updated and so an aborted rebalance can "roll back" without any data loss
  - Proxy gets & puts are established within the zone making improving performance during rebalance
* Coordinator
  - Added monitoring capability in the Coordinator

Release 1.3.3 on 04/24/2013
* VoldemortBuildandPush
  - Fixed bug with schema check
* Streaming Client
  - Fixed issue with redundant callback invocation
Release 1.3.1 on 03/25/2013
* HDFSFetcher
  - Fixed the bug in calculating checksums when we entere a retry loop
  - refactored per file checksums
  - added junit test case to simulate intermittent IO exceptions
* voldemort.client.protocol.admin.AdminClient
  - Added AdminStoreClient so that AdminClient can do store operations
    against specific store on a specific node.
  - Added helper methods for diong put & get for specific node/store
  - Added voldemort.client.protocol.admin.QueryKeyResult type to
    simplify QueryKey interface
* Improved FetchStreamRequestHandler and sub-classes
  - Renamed all sub-classes: 'FullScan' and 'PartitionScan' prefixes
    for pertinent stream request handler implementations.
  - Removed unused skipRecords parameter.
  - Added recordsPerPartition parameter to fetch limited portion of
    each partition.
  - All logic about how many keys to fetch (return to invoker) is
    server side now.
* RebalanceCLI
  - Added many options to help improve the balance of (zoned) clusters.
  - Analysis of the balance of a cluster is significantly more detailed.
  - Fixed a bug that reduced the balance of a cluster each time it was
    expanded.
  - Many different algorithms for improving cluster balance are
    implemented in voldemort.utils.RebalanceClusterUtils
* ConsistencyCheck & ConsistencyFixCLI
  - New tools for ensuring data durability. These tools are necessary
    because slop creation can fail during put operations.
  - ConsistencyCheck determines which keys, if any, lack
    "consistency". I.e., are present on only a subset of the expected
    partitions.
  - ConsistencyFix takes a list of bad (inconsistent) keys and makes
    sure they are present on all expected partitions.
  - ConsistencyFix also has an interface for repairing "orphaned" keys
    that could result from an aborted rebalance.
* KeySamplerCLI & KeyVersionFetcherCLI
  - KeySamplerCLI is a new tool that reads some number of keys for
    specified partitions/stores.
  - KeyVersionFetcherCLI is a new tool that, given a key and a store,
    fetches the version from all nodes that host a partition that
    ought to store a replica of the key's value.
  - Together, KeySamplerCLI and KeyVersionFetcherCLI correctly
    implement the intended functionality of the Entropy tool (for
    servers that implement either FullScan and PartitionScan fetches).
  - Entropy tool had been used in the past to verify a sample of keys
    before and after a rebalance. Entropy tool does not work as
    intended/expected. This is exacerbated by the partition aware
    layouts. Instead of trying to fix the Entropy tool, these two new
    tools were developed. Entropy is deprecated and will eventually be
    removed from the code base.
* Substantial refactoring of helper & util methods:
  - voldemort.cluster.Cluster : added helper methods
  - voldemort.utils.ClusterInstance : wraps up one Cluster &
    List<StoreDefinition>
  - voldemort.utils.Cluster : utils for single Cluster object.
  - voldemort.utils.NodeUtils : utils for Node object.
  - voldemort.utils.RebalanceUtils : Many methods moved to more
    appropriate helper classes
  - voldemort.utils.StoreDefinitionUtils : utils for StoreDefinition
    object.
  - voldemort.utils.StoreInstance : wraps up one Cluster & one
    StoreDefinition
* Et cetera
  - ByteUtils toHexString & from HexString now rely on standard
    libraries
  - voldemort.client.AdminFetchTest now tests FullScan and
    PartitionScan fetches
  - voldemort.store.routed.ReadRepairerTest annotated all tests with
    @Test

Release 1.0.0 on 10/17/2012

NOTE: The large version number jump from 0.96 to 1.0.0 is to
standardize on a version number of the sort MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.  This
change is part of our effort to treat internal and open source
releases in a much more similar manner. Along these lines, release

Release 0.90 on 7/10/2011

Changes made since 0.81
 * All upgrading instructions can be found here - https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort/wiki/Upgrading-from-0.81
 * Tooling
 - Single consolidated administrative tool - Got rid of the admin client
   shell and have a better Voldemort admin tool. More documentation -
   https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort/wiki/Voldemort-Admin-tool

 * Web manager
 - Basic GUI in JRuby ( and Sinatra ), capable of querying for store metadata.
 - Read contrib/web-manager/README.md for more details

 * Rebalancing
 - New better rebalancing support with (a) checkpointing (b) progress bar (c) support for RO store rebalancing
 - Documentation - https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort/wiki/Voldemort-Rebalancing
 - In the process solves Issue 203, 288, 305, 307, 311

 * Client side changes
 - Pipeline routed store ( with support for topology awareness ) - Changed the default client side routing
   to use a state machine like system. More documentation - https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort/wiki/RoutedStore-redesign
 - Lazy store client - Some of our clients are very inactive and don't really do many requests. For such
   clients it doesn't make sense to bootstrap the metadata at startup. Hence from now onwards clients instantiated
   from SocketStoreClientFactory give a LazyStoreClient which will not bootstrap till the first request is made
 - Caching store client factory - We have also checked-in a new store client factory which we use internally
   at LinkedIn to cache store clients for stores which we repeatedly.
 - Failure detector - We have fixed some bugs in the ThresholdFailureDetector. This is an improvement over the naive
   BannageFailureDetector which would aggressively mark nodes down after a single failure. More details -
   https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort/wiki/Client-side-failure-detector-implementations
 - Issue 219: StoreClient::put returns a Version - You may have to upgrade your clients since now the StoreClient returns
   a version to be used in successive requests.

 * Read-only store changes
 - Admin based store swapper - Till 0.81 we relied on a servlet based fetcher / swapper.
   Now we support an admin based store swapper which reports progress.

Release 0.81 on 6/15/2010

Changes made since 0.80.2:

* IMPORTANT: we have upgraded the Hadoop Core jar to v0.20.2. Since
  this version of Hadoop requires Java 6, in order to retain backwards
  compatibility with Java 5, you will need to replace this jar with
  the Hadoop 0.18.* core jar.
* Multiple donors for Voldemort Rebalancing: speeds up rebalancing, by
  allowing a single stealer node to transfer partitions from multiple
  nodes
* Features for EC2 Testing
* Read-only Stores: backwards compatibility with 0.70, bug fix in
  Checksum code
* Hadoop InputFormat, Pig LoadFunc in Contrib: ability to perform
  Map/Reduce (either directly via Hadoop or using Pig) over data in
  Voldemort stores. See:
  < contrib/hadoop/test/voldemort/hadoop/VoldemortWordCount.java > for
  an example.
* Voldemort Performance Tool: performance measurement tool based on
  YCSB (Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark) code. Run
  < bin/voldemort-performance-tool.sh --help > for more information.
* Reverted default failure detector implementation back to
  BannagedPeriodFailureDetector due to potential bugs in the
  ThresholdFailureDetector

Release 0.80.2 on 4/27/2010

Changes made since 0.80.1:

* Batched NIO writes (improves performance for AdminClient/Streaming
  operations when the NIO connector is enabled)
* VoldemortAdminTool: Added support to specify stores, support to
  fetch all keys to a binary file, support to save keys in ASCII
  (JSON) format [experimental], capability to add stores. Run
  < bin/voldemort-admin-tool.sh --help > for more information.
* Minor bug fixes for Rebalancing
* Issue 240: Voldemort fetcher should use different temp directories for
  different stores
* Checksum capability during construction of Voldemort read-only stores

Release 0.80.1 on 3/23/2010

Changes made since 0.80:

* Issue 133: Support for Apache Avro as a serialization format
* Issue 223: Changed the default client to use
  TresholdFailureDetector
* Fixed issue 222: Revised KeyedResourcePool.close(K key) to fix
  leaking sockets
* Fixed issue 198: Revised ReadRepairer to use a separate copy of the
  vector clock, fixing a situation where NoSuchElementException would
  be thrown
* Miscellaneous enhancement: support for TCP keep-alives, improved
  read only store utilities, command line interface to AdminClient,
  improved load testing tools

Release 0.80 on 2/18/2010

Changes made since 0.70.1:

* IMPORTANT: backwards compatibility between the client and server has
  changed. A backwards incompatibility in the wire protocol was found
  between releases 0.60 to 0.70.1 and releases prior to 0.60. We chose
  to make 0.80 compatible with 0.57.1 and earlier versions, while
  introducing an incompatibility with 0.60-0.70.1. What this means is
  that if you're presently running 0.60 and higher, you would need to
  upgrade the Voldemort jar files on *all* servers and clients.
* Upgraded the BDB storage engine to use BerkeleyDB-JE 4.0.92,
  retaining ability to use BerkeleyDB-JE 3.3.* if desired. IMPORTANT:
  if one switches from BerkeleyDB-JE 3.3.* to 4.0.92 they will be able
  to access all of existing data. Once a switch has been made to
  4.0.92 the data will not be readable by earlier versions of BDB. If
  there's a chance that a roll back to 3.3.* might be needed, the best
  course of action will be to make a backup of existing data
  prior to upgrading.
  Switching between 3.3.* and 4.0.* would also require rebuilding the
  class files (e.g., by running "ant clean && ant release" after
  replacing the BDB jar files).
* Compression support for read-only stores
* Increased the socket buffer size for transferring read-only
  stores from Hadoop for improved performance over high-latency links
* NIO support for the Admin Service, including Streaming
  Functionality
* Support for adding stores on the fly via the Admin
  Service
* Fixed issue 209: Incorrect object passed to List.contains in
  RebalanceUtils.getLatestCluster()
* Fixed issue 211: Unnecessary read repairs during getAll() with more
  than one key
* Other enhancements: better CLI for rebalancing, throttling in
  Admin Service is now based on all disk activity

Release 0.70.1 on 2/1/2010

Changes made since 0.70:

* Fixed issue 205: if no keys passed to getAll() were in partitions
  undergoing rebalancing, proxyGetAll() would be called with an
  empty list even if rebalancing wasn't happening

Release 0.70 on 1/27/2010

Changes made since 0.60.1:

* A beta of rebalancing (dynamic cluster expansion) support merged
  into the main branch. See the project's wiki for more information:
  http://wiki.github.com/voldemort/voldemort/voldemort-rebalancing
* New failure detector merged into the main branch:
  http://wiki.github.com/voldemort/voldemort/failure-detection
* Beta mechanism for restoring all of node's data from replicas on
  demand. This is an alternative to a more gradual mechanism provided
  by read-repair: useful when a machine is down for a prolonged period
  and is then re-inserted into the cluster.
  Invoked via JMX: the operation is restoreDataFromReplication in the
  voldemort.server.VoldemortServer MBean, with a mandatory parameter
  (integer >= 1) indicating the number of transfers to do in parallel.
* Simple gossip protocol (for cluster metadata) merged
  into the main branch. Disabled by default: use "enable.gossip=true"
  to enable, use "gossip.interval.ms" to set an interval at which gossip
  occurs (default: 30000 i.e., 30 seconds).
* Fixed issue 190: add a way of aggregating performance data over
  all stores
* Fixed issue 181: stack trackes shouldn't be filled for Obsolete
  version exception

Release 0.60.1 on 12/18/2009

Minor changes made since 0.60:

* Better logging in the exception thrown if config/.temp and
  config/.version are copied
* Bumping up the version to 0.60.1 in order to release updated
  archives, fixing an error in the stores.xml for single_node_cluster
  sample config

Release 0.60 on 12/15/2009

Changes made since 0.57.1:

  of entries between nodes, deleting entries on remote nodes,
  remotely deleting and updating metadata
* EC2 testing: a way to periodically run integration and performance
  tests which involve Voldemort instances on different machines
* Experimental support for views
* Interpolation search for read-only stores
* Support for large lists and strings in the JSON serializer
* LZF compression support
